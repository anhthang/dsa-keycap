# DSA Profile Keycaps

Step file (.step, .stp) models of DSA profile keycaps

1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.75, 6.25 unit keys with .step and .stl files are available for anyone that wants to print or edit the profile

**Dimensions:**

- Outer dimension of the key follows the equation x(19mm) - 0.8mm where x is the unit size of the face. This means that the 1u key is 18.2mm x 18.2mm at the base
- 2u, 2.25u, 2.75u keys have three MX mounts spaced at 12mm. This was based on the spacing of my Ducky One. I'm not sure if this is universal because I can't find any more info on stabilizing mounts.
- Touch surface depth is 1mm at the center.
- Minimum wall thickness is 1.8mm
